### Startup the app

To be able to run the app locally you have to set up two environment variables.

The Supabase url and the Supabase anon key. These are found in our Supabase project at 
Dashboard -> Project Settings, in the left side -> under configuration find API Settings
The environment variables needs to match the ones used in main.dart:
SUPABASE_URL=<paste in supabase url>
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<paste in supabase anon key>
