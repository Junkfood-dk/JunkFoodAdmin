# chefapp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# JunkFoodAdmin

```sh {"id":"01JAFJ9XWC3T1YER0KBK6EBXEG"}
# Don't forget to run the following when developing to rebuild riverpod providers
dart run build_runner watch -d

```

# Commit template

git commit -m"

### Startup the app

To be able to run the app locally you have to set up two environment variables.

The Supabase url and the Supabase anon key. These are found in our Supabase project at:
Dashboard -> Project Settings, in the left side -> under configuration find API Settings

The environment variables are parsed as flages in the command line like this:

flutter run lib/main.dart --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL= --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
